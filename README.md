## 👤 About Me

Hi! I'm **Aakash Singh**, a recent BTech CSE graduate specializing in Data Science and AI Research, currently completing my senior year at the University of Florida (GPA: 3.85/4.0).

My experience spans building production ML systems and conducting AI research:
- **At AiStrike**: Developed an AI Copilot using LLMs and RAG pipelines that boosted SOC efficiency by 60%, architecting scalable systems processing 20,000+ security advisories
- **Research**: Engineered CNN models achieving 95% accuracy for cancer detection (OSCC), collaborated with CSIR scientists on publications
- **Current Projects**: Building MiniIndicGPT (125M parameter Hindi LLM from scratch) and Sage.AI (natural language SQL assistant using LangGraph)

I'm passionate about applying NLP and LLMs to specialized domains - which is why this medical NER assignment for **Miimansa AI** was particularly exciting. Medical AI sits at the intersection of technical challenge and real-world impact, and I wanted to explore how modern LLMs handle the nuances of patient-generated medical text.

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

### Task Description

Extract medical entities from patient forum posts in the CADEC (CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus) dataset:

**Entity Types**:
- **ADR** (Adverse Drug Reactions): Side effects from medications
- **Drug**: Medication names
- **Disease**: Medical conditions being treated
- **Symptom**: Disease symptoms (not drug side effects)

**Challenges**:
1. Informal patient language ("feel a bit weird" vs "malaise")
2. Context-dependent labels (pain from disease vs pain from drug)
3. Variable entity boundaries ("drowsy" vs "a bit drowsy")
4. 1,250 files with expert annotations

### Why This Is Hard

Medical NER on patient-generated content differs from clinical notes:

| Clinical Notes | Patient Forums |
|----------------|----------------|
| Standardized terminology | Colloquial expressions |
| Clear entity boundaries | Vague descriptions |
| Professional context | Emotional narratives |
| "Patient exhibits dyspnea" | "Can't catch my breath, scary!" |

Zero-shot LLMs must handle this variability without task-specific training.

## 🔬 Two Approaches Explored

### Approach 1: Quantized Llama-3-8B (On-Device)

**Hypothesis**: Open-source quantized models can perform medical NER offline

<details>
<summary><b>📉 Results: Failed (Click to expand)</b></summary>

**Performance**: F1 = 0.246 (60% below baseline)

**Architecture**:
```
Llama-3-8B-Instruct
    ↓
4-bit NF4 Quantization (bitsandbytes)
    ↓
BIO Tagging Prompt
    ↓
Parse → Extract Entities
```

**What Went Wrong**:

1. **Entity Fragmentation**
   ```
   Ground Truth: "severe numbness in hand"
   Predicted: "Severe" | "numbness in" | "hand" (3 separate entities)
   ```

2. **Unparseable Output** (18% of files)
   ```
   LLM Output: "low/O B-ADR mood/O, loss/O of/O I-ADR"
   Parser: Extracted 0 entities
   ```

3. **Quantization Quality Loss**
   - Medical reasoning severely degraded
   - Pattern recognition inconsistent
   - 4-bit compression destroyed domain knowledge

**Key Insight**: Accessibility (on-device, privacy) doesn't compensate for unusable performance.

### Approach 2: Gemini 2.0 Flash + LangGraph (Cloud API)

**Hypothesis**: Structured workflows with capable models achieve production-ready performance

<details open>
<summary><b>✅ Results: Success (Click to expand)</b></summary>

**Performance**: F1 = 0.573 (competitive with BioBERT zero-shot)

**Architecture**:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> GenerateBIO
    GenerateBIO --> ParseEntities: Gemini API
    ParseEntities --> MapSpans: Extract tuples
    MapSpans --> Postprocess: Find positions
    Postprocess --> LoadGroundTruth: Context-aware ADR
    LoadGroundTruth --> Evaluate: Load annotations
    Evaluate --> [*]: Calculate metrics
    
    note right of GenerateBIO
        Temperature: 0.1
        Format: word/TAG
        Few-shot examples
    end note
    
    note right of Postprocess
        Reclassify Symptoms
        near drugs as ADR
    end note
```

**Why This Worked**:

1. **Reliable Output Format**
   ```python
   I/O feel/O a/O bit/O drowsy/B-ADR
   have/O a/O little/O blurred/B-ADR vision/I-ADR
   gastric/B-ADR problems/I-ADR
   ```

2. **Better Medical Understanding**
   - Correctly identifies multi-word ADRs
   - Distinguishes disease symptoms from drug side effects
   - Handles informal patient language

3. **LangGraph Modularity**
   - Each step is debuggable
   - Easy to add validation/retry logic
   - State carries context between operations

**Performance Breakdown** (50 files):

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Precision | 0.579 |
| Recall | 0.597 |
| F1 | **0.573** |
| Complete Failures | 8% |
| Good Performance (F1≥0.6) | 58% |

**Per-Entity Performance**:

```
ADR:      P=0.63  R=0.63  F1=0.63  ✓ Strong
Drug:     P=0.88  R=0.60  F1=0.71  ✓ Excellent precision
Disease:  P=0.15  R=0.60  F1=0.24  ❌ Over-predicts
Symptom:  P=0.28  R=0.31  F1=0.29  ⚠️ Weak
```

## 🔍 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Why LangGraph Over Simple Functions?

**Problem with monolithic approach**:
```python
# Hard to debug
result = llm_predict(text)  # Where did it fail? 🤷
```

**LangGraph solution**:
```python
# Each step is isolated and debuggable
state → generate_bio → parse_entities → map_spans → evaluate
         ✓             ✓                ✓            ✓
```

**Benefits**:
- Inspect state after any node
- Add retry logic at specific steps
- Easy to A/B test components
- Clear error attribution

### 2. Why Relaxed Matching (66% Jaccard)?

**Clinical Reality Example**:

```
Ground Truth: "bit drowsy"
Predicted: "drowsy"

Strict matching: FAIL (different character spans)
Our matching: SUCCESS (core medical concept captured)
```

**Justification**: For clinical utility, extracting "drowsy" is 95% as good as "bit drowsy". Penalizing minor modifier differences doesn't reflect real-world value.

### 3. Why Context-Aware ADR Detection?

**Problem**: Model can't distinguish:
```
"pain from my arthritis" → Symptom ✓
"pain after taking Lipitor" → ADR ✓
```

**Solution**: Post-processing heuristic
```python
if entity == 'Symptom':
    if drug_mention_nearby and drug_entity_within_150_chars:
        reclassify_as_ADR()
```

**Impact**: Improved ADR recall by ~4%

### 4. Why Few-Shot Over Zero-Shot?

**Evolution**:

| Prompt Version | F1 | Key Addition |
|----------------|-----|--------------|
| Zero-shot | 0.35 | Just definitions |
| 2-shot | 0.45 | Basic examples |
| 5-shot with edge cases | 0.57 | **Current** |

**Key Insight**: Generic examples don't help. Need to show problematic cases:
- Multi-word ADRs with modifiers
- Numbers separate from drug names
- Context-dependent Symptom vs ADR

## 💡 What I Learned

### 1. Model Choice > Prompt Engineering

**Before**: Spent 2 days optimizing Llama prompts
**Result**: F1 improved from 0.20 to 0.25

**After**: Switched to Gemini
**Result**: F1 jumped to 0.57

**Takeaway**: Pick the right tool first. You can't prompt-engineer around fundamental model limitations.

### 2. Structure Beats Cleverness

LangGraph's simple state machine was more valuable than any clever prompt trick. Clear, debuggable pipelines > monolithic "smart" code.

### 3. Medical NER Needs Domain Knowledge

Even Gemini struggles with:
- Disease vs biomarker ("cholesterol")
- Symptom vs ADR without explicit context
- Informal medical terminology mapping

**Implication**: Zero-shot has limits. Production systems need either:
- Fine-tuning on domain data
- Hybrid rule-based + LLM approaches
- Human-in-the-loop validation

### 4. Evaluation Methodology Shapes Perception

Same predictions, different metrics:

| Matching Type | F1 Score | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| Strict (exact spans) | 0.40 | Research benchmarking |
| Relaxed (66% overlap) | 0.57 | Clinical utility |

Both are "correct" - depends on what matters for your application.

### 5. Privacy vs Performance Trade-Off

**Llama approach**: Complete privacy, no API costs, offline
**Gemini approach**: Cloud dependency, per-query cost

**Reality**: Privacy doesn't matter if the system doesn't work. Gemini's F1 = 0.57 is usable; Llama's F1 = 0.25 is not.

3. **Active learning pipeline**
   - Identify low-confidence predictions
   - Manual correction → few-shot examples
   - Iterative improvement
   - Expected: F1 = 0.80+ over time
