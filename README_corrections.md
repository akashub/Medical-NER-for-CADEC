# Medical NER Development Log: Trials, Issues, and Lessons Learned

## Project Context

**Goal**: Extract medical entities (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom) from informal patient forum posts using zero-shot LLM approach.

**Dataset**: CADEC (CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus) - 1,250 patient forum posts with expert annotations

**Approach**: Mistral-7B-Instruct with BIO tagging format

**Status**: ⚠️ System underperforming (F1 = 0.096, 60% complete failures)

---

## Timeline of Development

### Initial Attempt: Basic BIO Prompting

**Approach**: Simple prompt asking model to generate BIO tags

**Results on Test File (ARTHROTEC.1.txt)**:
- F1 = 0.33
- Issues: Missing entities, inconsistent boundaries

**Problems Identified**:
1. Model generated invalid tags (`B-MODIFIER`, `B-DAY`, `B-DOSAGE`)
2. Output truncated mid-sentence on longer texts
3. Inconsistent inclusion of modifiers ("a bit drowsy" vs "bit drowsy")

---

### Iteration 2: Few-Shot Examples + Format Enforcement

**Changes**:
- Added 4-5 concrete examples in prompt
- Explicit list of valid tags only
- Increased `max_new_tokens` to 2048
- Lowered temperature to 0.2

**Results on Test File**:
- F1 = 1.0 (with 66% Jaccard threshold)
- All 8 entities matched

**False Confidence**: This result was misleading because:
1. Prompt examples were similar to test file structure
2. Test file was short and well-structured
3. Relaxed matching (66% word overlap) was very lenient
4. Single file doesn't show generalization

---

### Reality Check: 10 Random Files Evaluation

**Results**:
```
Macro-Avg F1: 0.096
Complete failures (F1=0): 6/10 (60%)
Poor (0 < F1 < 0.3): 3/10 (30%)
Moderate (0.3 ≤ F1 < 0.6): 1/10 (10%)
```

**System collapsed on diverse real-world texts.**

---

## Critical Failure Modes Discovered

### Failure Mode 1: ADR vs Symptom Confusion (Most Severe)

**Example from LIPITOR.521.txt**:

```
Ground Truth: "Severe numbness in hand" = ADR
Model Output:  "Severe numbness" = Symptom

Ground Truth: "Tingling in feet" = ADR  
Model Output:  "Tingling" = Symptom

Ground Truth: "soreness in calf muscles" = ADR
Model Output:  "soreness in" = Symptom
```

**Impact**: 
- Precision = 0.14, Recall = 0.17, F1 = 0.15
- The model systematically mislabels drug side effects as disease symptoms

**Why This Happens**:
- Patient reports are about medication side effects
- But the model defaults to "Symptom" for any physical complaint
- 7B models lack context understanding to distinguish:
  - "numbness from Lipitor" (ADR) vs "numbness from diabetes" (Symptom)

---

### Failure Mode 2: Complete Label Failure

**Example from LIPITOR.64.txt**:

```
Ground Truth (all ADRs):
- low mood
- loss of self-confidence  
- loss of interest in life
- brain fog
- impaired memory

Model Output (all as Symptom):
- low mood (Symptom) ❌
- self-confidence (Symptom) ❌
- interest (Symptom) ❌
- impaired memory (Symptom) ❌

Performance: Precision = 0.0, Recall = 0.0, F1 = 0.0
```

**Why**: The entire post is about Lipitor side effects, but model didn't understand context.

---

### Failure Mode 3: Invalid Tags Persist

Despite explicit restrictions, model still generates:

```
calf/I-BodyPart          ❌
Occassional/B-Quantity   ❌
reading/B-Symptom        ❌ (verb, not a symptom)
periods/B-Symptom        ❌ (temporal, not medical)
```

**Impact**: Parser silently skips these, reducing recall.

---

### Failure Mode 4: Incomplete Multi-Word Entities

**Ground Truth**: "sharp shock like pain in head"  
**Model Output**: "shock" + "pain" (separate, incomplete)

**Ground Truth**: "loss of self-confidence"  
**Model Output**: "self-confidence" (missing "loss of")

**Impact**: Even when detected, boundaries are wrong, causing matching failures.

---

### Failure Mode 5: Format Corruption

**LLM Output Examples**:
```
pain/B-Symptom,          # Comma in tag
mood/O,/                 # Double punctuation
/S-ADR                   # Missing word
```

**Impact**: Parser cannot extract entities from malformed output.

## Why Mistral-7B is Failing

### 1. Model Size Limitations

**7B parameters insufficient for**:
- Understanding medical context deeply
- Distinguishing subtle label differences (ADR vs Symptom)
- Maintaining format discipline on diverse inputs
- Long-range context (patient history across paragraphs)

**Evidence**: 
- Supervised medical NER models use 110M+ parameters specifically fine-tuned
- GPT-3.5 (175B) achieves F1 ~0.35-0.45 on this task zero-shot
- Our 7B getting F1 = 0.096 is below viable threshold

### 2. Domain Mismatch

**Mistral-7B training**:
- General web text, code, instruction-following
- Limited medical text exposure

**CADEC requirements**:
- Informal patient language ("feel weird", "brain fog")
- Medical terminology mapping
- Context-dependent label assignment

**Gap**: The model hasn't seen enough medical text to understand:
- "Numbness" after starting medication = ADR
- "Numbness" from diabetes = Symptom

### 3. Instruction-Following Limits

**Despite explicit instructions**:
- "ONLY use these tags: B-ADR, I-ADR..."
- Model still invents `B-BodyPart`, `B-Quantity`

**Why**: Smaller models struggle with strict constraint adherence on complex tasks.

### 4. Prompt Overfitting

**What happened**:
- Prompt examples were well-structured, short texts
- Real CADEC posts are long, rambling, informal
- Model memorized example patterns but couldn't generalize

**Evidence**:
- Test file (similar to examples): F1 = 1.0
- Random files (more diverse): F1 = 0.096

---

## Attempted Fixes That Didn't Work

### Fix Attempt 1: Stricter Format Rules

**Changes**:
- Added negative examples ("DO NOT do this")
- Explicit valid tag list
- Format examples with punctuation handling

**Result**: Invalid tags reduced but still present (20% → 10% of tokens)

**Why it failed**: Model fundamentally doesn't have capacity for strict format adherence.

---

### Fix Attempt 2: Increased Context Window

**Changes**:
- Reduced input `max_length` to 1200
- Increased output `max_new_tokens` to 3072

**Result**: Fewer truncation errors, but didn't improve accuracy

**Why it failed**: Problem isn't output length, it's understanding.

---

### Fix Attempt 3: Temperature Tuning

**Tried**:
- Temperature 0.2 → 0.1 → 0.05 → 0.03

**Result**: Slightly more consistent format, no accuracy improvement

**Why it failed**: Lower temperature makes output more deterministic, but if the model doesn't understand the task, it just makes the same mistakes consistently.

---

### Fix Attempt 4: Aggressive Post-Processing

**Changes**:
- Context-aware ADR reclassification
- Boundary trimming
- Invalid tag filtering

**Result**: Helped marginally (F1 +0.02), but can't fix wrong labels

**Why it failed**: Can't post-process your way out of fundamentally wrong predictions.

---

### Fix Attempt 5: Enhanced Few-Shot Examples

**Changes**:
- Added examples for all entity types
- Showed ADR vs Symptom distinction
- Included multi-word entity examples

**Result**: Test file improved (F1 = 1.0), but random files still failed (F1 = 0.096)

**Why it failed**: Examples helped memorization, not generalization.

---

## Performance Breakdown by Issue Type

### Error Analysis (10 Random Files)

**Label Confusion** (50% of errors):
- ADR mislabeled as Symptom: 28 instances
- Symptom mislabeled as ADR: 4 instances
- Drug mislabeled as Disease: 2 instances

**Boundary Errors** (25% of errors):
- Partial extraction: "numbness" vs "severe numbness in hand"
- Missing modifiers: "blurred vision" vs "little blurred vision"
- Over-extraction: "Arthrotec 50" vs "Arthrotec"

**Complete Misses** (15% of errors):
- Entities not detected at all
- Usually in second half of long texts

**Format Errors** (10% of errors):
- Invalid tags causing parser rejection
- Malformed output (commas in tags)

---

## What Would Actually Work

### Option 1: Larger Model

**Use Llama-3-70B or GPT-4**:
- Expected F1: 0.5-0.6 (5-6x improvement)
- Better context understanding
- Stronger instruction-following

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires more GPU memory or API costs
- Slower inference

---

### Option 2: Fine-Tuning

**Train on CADEC training set**:
- Use BioBERT or PubMedBERT as base
- Fine-tune on 1000 annotated posts
- Expected F1: 0.55-0.65

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires training infrastructure
- Time-consuming (hours to train)
- Less flexible than prompt-based

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Combine LLM + Rules**:
- Use LLM for entity detection
- Apply rule-based post-processing for ADR/Symptom distinction
- Pattern: "after taking X" → adjacent symptoms = ADR

**Expected F1**: 0.3-0.4 (3-4x improvement)

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires manual rule engineering
- Rules may be brittle

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Zero-Shot Has Limits

**Lesson**: Zero-shot prompting works for simple, well-defined tasks. Medical NER on informal text is NOT simple.

**Evidence**: 
- Our F1 = 0.096
- Literature baseline (supervised): F1 = 0.55-0.65
- GPT-4 zero-shot: F1 = 0.5-0.6

**Gap**: 7B models need fine-tuning for specialized domains.

---

### 2. Single Example Performance is Misleading

**What happened**:
- Test file: F1 = 1.0 ✓
- Random files: F1 = 0.096 ✗

**Lesson**: Always evaluate on diverse test set before celebrating.

---

### 3. Relaxed Metrics Can Hide Problems

**Our matching**:
- 66% Jaccard similarity threshold
- "a bit drowsy" ≈ "bit drowsy" (counts as match)

**Problem**: Inflates scores, hides boundary issues

**Better approach**: Report both strict and relaxed metrics.

---

### 4. Prompt Engineering Has Diminishing Returns

**What we tried**:
- 5 iterations of prompt refinement
- Examples, rules, constraints, negative examples
- Temperature tuning, parameter adjustments

**Result**: Marginal improvements only

**Lesson**: Can't prompt-engineer around fundamental model limitations.

---

### 5. Medical NER Requires Domain Knowledge

**Challenge**: ADR vs Symptom distinction requires understanding:
- Medical causality (what causes what)
- Temporal context (before/after medication)
- Patient narrative structure

**7B models**: Don't have this encoded in their weights

**Solution**: Need medical pre-training or fine-tuning

---

## Current Recommendations

### For This Assignment

**Honest Reporting**:
1. Report actual performance: F1 = 0.096
2. Analyze failure modes (shown above)
3. Discuss why 7B models insufficient
4. Propose improvements (larger models, fine-tuning)

**Why this is valuable**:
- Shows deep understanding of NER challenges
- Demonstrates critical evaluation skills
- More educational than lucky success with over-tuned system

---

### If You Want Better Results

**Quick win**: Switch to Llama-3-8B-Instruct
```python
model_id = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
# Expected F1: 0.3-0.4 (3-4x improvement)
```

**Best results**: Use API model
```python
# OpenAI GPT-4o-mini or Anthropic Claude-3-Haiku
# Expected F1: 0.5-0.6 (5-6x improvement)
```

**Production-ready**: Fine-tune BioBERT
```python
# Fine-tune on CADEC training set
# Expected F1: 0.55-0.65
```

## What Success Would Look Like

### Acceptable Performance (F1 ≥ 0.4)

**Characteristics**:
- Catches most obvious entities
- Some label confusion but reasonable
- Could assist human annotators
- Requires review but saves time

---

### Good Performance (F1 ≥ 0.55)

**Characteristics**:
- Matches supervised baselines
- Reliable for clinical use (with review)
- Minimal label confusion
- Rare complete failures

---

### Excellent Performance (F1 ≥ 0.65)

**Characteristics**:
- Beats some supervised systems
- Production-ready for many applications
- Low error rate
- Requires fine-tuning or very large models

---

## Conclusion

**Current system**: Not viable for real use (F1 = 0.096)

**Core problem**: 7B model too small for zero-shot medical NER on informal text

**Path forward**:
1. **For learning**: Document failures, analyze deeply (more valuable educationally)
2. **For results**: Switch to larger model or fine-tuning approach

**Key insight**: Sometimes understanding *why* something fails teaches more than making it work through brute force.
